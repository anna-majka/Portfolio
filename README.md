# Portfolio
My portfolio project.

In autumn 2020 I followed a Skillshare class "Code your own portfolio - HTML & CSS basics" by Aga Naplocha. Never coded before, so it was a whole new exciting experience. I loved it!

This portfolio is based on my very first project, but I tried to improve it as possible: simple font, limited color palette, and only most relevant information. I used HTML and CSS.

I hope this will help me to find an apprenticeship as a front-end developer.
