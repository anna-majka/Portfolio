# Portfolio
My portfolio project.

### Background
In autumn 2020 I followed a Skillshare class ["Code your own portfolio - HTML & CSS basics"](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Code-your-own-portfolio-%E2%80%93-HTML-CSS-basics/1042721241) by [Aga Naplocha](https://theawwwesomes.org/). Never coded before, so it was a whole new exciting experience. I loved it!

### Project
This portfolio is based on my very first project, but I tried to improve it as possible: 
* simple font
* limited color palette
* only most relevant information


### Coding journal
I added a page called "Journal de code" (coding journal) where I show how and what am I currently learning, courses I'm taking, books I'm reading, etc.
